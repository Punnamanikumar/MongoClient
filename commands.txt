Mongo : 
        This command basically takes you inside mongobd, this can have multiple databases.

Mongo Client:
        it allows you to communicate and make all the
        queries from VS code instead of making e queries from mongo shell.
use school:
        this command is use to create the database if db is not already existed.and if
        exists then it will switch you to that database.

db.createCollection("students") is used to create the collection in database.

**  actualDb.collection("students").find().toArray() //to array extra in vs code

If the collection is empty then the output will not be blank like mongo shell
instead it will return an empty array.
